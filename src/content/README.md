## Add a new blog post

To add a new blog post, create a new Markdown file in the `src/content/blog` directory.
Each blog post file should include frontmatter metadata at the top, such as title, date, and tags. For example:

```markdown
---
title: "First post"
description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
pubDate: "Jul 08 2022"
updateDate: "Jan 08 2025"
heroImage: "../../assets/codecarbon-logo.svg"
