CodeCarbon is proud to be part of the 🚀 **Mozilla Foundation Incubator** 🚀

# Mozilla Foundation 🏢

The Mozilla Foundation is best known for the [Firefox browser](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/), but it also supports a large number of initiatives and projects, all dedicated to building a future where technology is powered by people, and open by design.

They've just launched the Mozilla Foundation Incubator -- **and we are proud to have been selected in the first cohort**.

# The Grant 💰

Above and beyond the grant itself, we are really happy to get coaching from some amazing experts in different fields, who will work with our team on strategy, operations and design.

This will not only allow us to make CodeCarbon a better tool, but also to grow our community and become a financially sustainable non-profit.
