CodeCarbon is proud to be part of the Mozilla Foundation Incubator.

# Mozilla Foundation

The Mozilla Foundation is dedicated to make a better technology future. It's the parent of the Mozilla Corporation, well known for [Firefox browser](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/). The foundation also supports a large number of initiatives.

They have just launched the Mozilla Foundation Incubator and we are proud to have been selected in the first cohort.

# The Grant

We are really happy to get some money, moreover we will receive coaching from amazing people.

This will allow us to make CodeCarbon a better tool, grow our community and figure out how to became a financially sustainable non-profit.
