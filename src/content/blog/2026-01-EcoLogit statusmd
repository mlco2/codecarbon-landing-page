# CodeCarbon and Ecologits are joining forces

Big News for a More Responsible Digital Future! 2025 was a landmark year for CodeCarbon :
- Joining the Mozilla Foundation Incubator to amplify our long-term impact,
- Participating in the GitHub Open Source Secure Fund to ensure the safety and trust of our users,
- Multiple package releases, bringing new features and improvements to our community.

And today, we’re thrilled to announce a major milestone: CodeCarbon and Ecologits are joining forces under the same non-profit ! 
Two complementary projects, driven by passionate teams and a shared commitment to scientific rigor, are coming together to make the environmental impact assessment of AI simpler, more transparent, and accessible to all. Our merged efforts will leverage robust, widely adopted open-source tools to empower organizations to measure and reduce their digital carbon footprint. This alliance paves the way for:
- Enhanced technical and partnership capabilities,
- Deeper methodological expertise,
- Greater impact across the responsible digital ecosystem.

Looking ahead to 2026:
We are excited to announce a new partnership with ADEME (a French Ministry for Ecology agency) and Institut Louis Bachelier, to further simplify the use of EcoLogits and CodeCarbon, and to accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices in AI and computing.

Stay tuned—the adventure is just beginning. 🚀
